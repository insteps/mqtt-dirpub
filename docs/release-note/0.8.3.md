  (earlier experimental), has been formalized, though the method
  and I/O should remain relatively put. but underlying method calls
  may change.
* NOTE: use of `@id` in `--fmask` or with `-F` does not quiet work as
  expected, but should work alongwith `-q 2` (not fully tested though).

* Fix empty `--fmask` issues
* Updated changes from mosquitto.org(v1.6.8).
